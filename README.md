# resume-skills-roadmapper
Instead of a Google Docs table, I wrote up a UI to display a table of skills & link them to experience cards. After building the app, writing in the content was a great refresher and stored all the info for me in the browser cache (and I exported the JSON info as a text file).

## Features
- Layout Persistence in Next.js: [tutorial](https://dev.to/ozanbolel/layout-persistence-in-next-js-107g)
- Editable table items in react-table: [tutorial 1](https://codesandbox.io/s/ewm82), [tutorial 2](https://codesandbox.io/s/j72j9767zv), and [official docs](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/tannerlinsley/react-table/tree/master/examples/basic)

## Next.js Default
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

### TO DO
- page for table of skills
- page for list of experience cards
- (create experience cards)
- (create skills & link them based on the dropdown)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
